## Microsoft Privacy Principles
Microsoft's approach to privacy is built on six principles:

* **Control**: Putting the customer in control of their data and privacy with easy-to-use tools and clear choices. Microsoft will not use your data without your agreement, and when there is an agreement, Microsoft uses the data to provide only the services the customer has chosen. Control over customer's data is reinforced by Microsoft compliance with broadly applicable privacy laws and privacy standards.
* **Transparency**: Being transparents about data collection and use so that everyone can make informed decisions. Microsoft only process data based on a customer's agreement and in accordance with the strict policies and procedures that has been contractually agreed to. When Microsoft deploy subcontractors or subprocessors to perform work that requires access to customers' data, they can perform only the fuctions that Microsoft has hired them to provide, and are bound by the same contractual privacy commitments that Microsoft makes to the customer. 
* **Security**: State-of-the-art encryption is used to protect customers' data both at rest and in transit. The encryption protocols erect barriers against unauthorised access to the data, including two or more independent encryption layers to protect against compromises of any one layer. All Microsoft-managed encryption keys are properly secured and offer the use of technologies such as Azure Key Vault to help customers control access to passwords, encryption keys and other secrets.
* **Strong legal protections**: Microsoft defends customers' data through clearly defined and well-established response policies and processes, strong contractual commitments, and if necessary, the courts. Microsoft does not give any government direct or unfettered access to customers' data, and will not disclose data to a government or law enforcement agency, except as the customer directs or where required by law.
* **No content-based targeting**: Not using email, chat, files or other personal content to target advertising. Microsoft does not share customers' data with advertiser-supported services, nor do they mine it for any purposes like marketing research or advertising.
* **Benefits to customer**: When Microsoft does collect data, its used to benefit the customer, and make experiences better.

## Microsoft Priva
Microsoft Priva helps customers understand the data the organisation stores by automating discovery of personal data assets and providing visualisations of essential information. These visualisations can be found on the overview and data profile pages, currently accessible through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

Priva evaluates the organisation's data stored in the following Microsoft 365 services within the Microsoft 365 tenant:

* Exchange Online
* SharePoint Online
* OneDrive for Business
* Microsoft Teams

Privacy Risk Management in Microsoft Priva also gives the capability to set up policies that identify privacy risks in the Microsoft 365 environment and enable easy remediation. Privacy Risk Management policies are meant to be internal guides and can help:

* Detect overexposed personal data so that users can secure it.
* Spot and limit transfers of personal data across departments or regional borders.
* Help users identify and reduce the amount of unused personal data being stored.
