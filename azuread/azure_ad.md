# Azure Active Directory

Microsoft Azure Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. Organisations use Azure AD to enable their employees, guests, and others to sign in and access the resources they need.

Azure AD:
* Simplifies the way organisations manage authorisation and access by providing a single identity system (SSO) for their cloud and on-premises applications
* Can be synchronised with your existing on-premises Active Directory (AD), synchronised with other directory services or used as a standable service. 
* Allows organisations to securely enable the use of personal devices
* Enable collaboration with business partners and customers
* Control access to corporate apps and resources, based on business requirements 
* Set up to require multi-factor authentication when accessing important organisational resources 
* Can be used to automate user provisioning between an existing Windows Server AD and cloud apps, including Microsoft 365 
* Provides powerful tools to automatically help protect user identities, credentials and to meet an organisation's access goverance requirements

Developers use Azure AD as a standards-based approach for adding SSO to their apps, so that users can sign in with their pre-existing credentials. Azure AD also provides APIs that allow developers to build personalised app experiences using existing organisational data. 

Subscribers to Azure services, Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365 automatically have access to Azure AD. Users of these services can take advantage of included Azure AD services and can also enhance their Azure AD implementation by upgrading to Azure Premium licenses.
