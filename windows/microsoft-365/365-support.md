| Uptime                          | The total time your services are functional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Service credit                  | The percentage of the applicable monthly service fees credited following Microsoft's claim approval.

Service credits apply only to fees paid for the particular service, service resource or service tier for which a service level hasnt been met. |
| Uptime agreement                | The uptime agreement is defined by the monthly uptime percentage. This percentage is for a given active tenant in a calendar month and the calculation varies depending on the product or service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The percentage of service credit an organisation can receive is linked to the monthly uptime percentage.

Service Level Agreements should always be reviewed and ask questions including:

* If using a Cloud Service Provider, how do they determine service levels and whether they're achieved or not?
* Who is responisble for reports? How can organisations access reports?
* Are there any exceptions in the agreement?
* What does the agreement say about both unexpected and scheduled maintenance?
* What does the agreement say about what happens if infrastructure goes down because of an attack? What about natural disasters and other situations outside of your control?
* Does the agreement cover non-Microsoft service or system failures?
* What are the limites to the CSP's liability in the agreement?
