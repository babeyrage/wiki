### Compliance Manager
Compliance Manager can help organisations throughout their compliance journey, from taking inventory of data protection risks, to managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications and reporting to auditors. Compliance Manager helps simplify compliance and reduce risk by providing:

* Prebuilt assessments based on common regional and industry regulations and standards. Admins can also use custom assessment to help with compliance needs unique to the organisation.
* Workflow capabilities that enable admins to efficiently complete risk assessments for the organisation.
* Step-by-step improvement actions that admins can take to help meet regulation and standards relevant to the organisation. Some actions will also be managed for the organisation by Microsoft. Admins will get implementation details and audit results for those actions.
* Compliance score, which is a calculation that helps an organisation understand its overall compliance posture by meauring how it's progressing with improvement actions.

Compliance Manager uses several data elements to help manage compliance activities. Ad admins use Compliance Manager to assign, test and monitor compliance activities, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of the key elements: controls, assessments, templates and improvement actions.

### Controls
A control is a requirement of a regulation, standard or policy. It defines how to assess and manage system configuration, organisational process and people responsible for meeting a specific requirement of a regulation, standard or policy.

Compliance Manager tracks the following types of controls:

* **Microsoft-managed controls**: controls for Microsoft cloud services, which Microsoft is responsible for implementing.
* **Your controls**: sometimes referred to as customer-managed controls, these are implemented and managed by the organisation.
* **Shared controls**: responsibility for implementing these controls is shared by the organisation and Microsoft.

Compliance Manager continuously assesses controls by scanning through the Microsoft 365 environment and detecting the system settings, continuously and automatically updating the technical action status.

### Assessments
An assessment is a grouping of controls from a specific regulation, standard or policy. Completing the actions within an assessment helps to meet the requirements of a standard, regulation or law. An assessment consists of several components including the services that are in-scope, the controls and an assessment score that shows progress towards completing the actions needed for compliance.

### Templates
Compliance manager provides templates to quickly create assessments. The templates can be modified to create an assessment optimised for the organisation's needs. Admins can also build a custom assessment by creating a template with their own controls and actions. 

### Improvement actions
Improvement actions help centralise compliance activities. Each improvement action provides recommended guidance that's intended to help organisations to align with data protection regulations and standards. Improvement actions can be assigned to users in the organisation to do implementation and testing work. Admins can lso store documentation, notes and record status updates within the improvement action.
