### Glossary

##### Communication Protocol:
A system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information.

##### Protocol: 
Defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronisation of communication and possible error recovery methods.

**IPv4**: Internet Protocol Version 4
**IPv6**: Internet Protocol Version 6
**TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol
**UDP**: User Datagram Protocol

##### MAC Address:
*Media Access Control address* is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address  in communications within a network segment. MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator. First half of a MAC address is typically the manufacturer's organisational unique identifier (OUI), the second half is a unique number.

##### ARP:
*Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)* is a protocol or procedure that connects an ever-changing IP address to a MAC address, in a local-area network (LAN).

##### DHCP: 
*Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)* is a network management protocol used on networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with eachother, and other IP networks.

##### NAT:

##### DNS:


##### OSI Model: 
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is the most rigorously defined. There are 7 layers in the OSI model which has 2 layers between the transport and application layer.

##### TCP/IP Model: 
The *Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol* Model is a 5 layer "hybrid" of the OSI Model, whereby it combines the *Session Layer*, *Presentation Layer* and the *Application Layer* into the *Application Layer*.
