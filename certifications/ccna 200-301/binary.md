All computers function by using a system of switches that can either be on or off. 

Binary consists of 2 states or values.
* Off = 0
* On = 1
Binary values = 0 or 1

| Base ^ Exponent | $2^7$ | $2^6$ | $2^5$ | $2^4$ | $2^3$ | $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
| --------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Binary          | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     |

#### What is 192 written in decimal? 

##### Method 1: 
Go through minusing number from decimal amounts, any amount with positive integer is 1, anything else is 0.

192 - 128 = 64 = 1
64 - 64 = 0 = 1
0 - 32 = -32 = 0
0 - 16 = -16 = 0
0 - 8 = -8 = 0
0 - 4 = -4 = 0
0 - 2 = -2 = 0
0 - 1 = -1 = 0

192 in decimal = 11000000

##### Method 2:
Minus the number from the cumulative figure, work out which decimal figure goes into that amount which would be 0's.

255 (Cumulative) - 192 = 63 (which is cumulative of 1 - 32) = 11000000

#### What is 253 written in decimal?

##### Method 1:

253 - 128 = 125 = 1
125 - 64 = 61 = 1
61 - 32 = 29 = 1
29 - 16 = 13 = 1
13 - 8 = 5 = 1
5 - 4 = 1 = 1
1 - 2 = -1 = 0
1 - 1 = 0 = 1

253 in decimal = 11111101

##### Method 2:

255 - 253 = 2 = 11111101

### Converting IP addresses to binary

IPv4 address is a 32bit number made up of 4 octects (4 x 8bits) in the range of 0 to 255

10.129.16.123 = 00001010.10000001.00010000.01111011
192.168.1.72 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.01001000
